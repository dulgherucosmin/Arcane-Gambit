# Arcane-Gambit

Arcane Gambit is a non-traditional card game played in the console. The aim of the game is to use the different cards in your randomised deck in order to defeat your opponent and get them to 0 health before they do it to you.

This project was originally developed for my first year Computer Programming module, and I decided to rewrite and upgrade the code after the project was due.
